A fast-paced 3D space tunnel racing game built with Three.js.

## Project Overview

Tunnel Riders is a web-based game where players pilot a spaceship through procedurally generated tunnels while battling enemies and collecting upgrades. For detailed game mechanics and planned features, see [specs.md](specs.md).

## Purpose

This is a "vibe coding" project to explore:
- How far we can get in 2-3 hours of development
- Following a pre-generated detailed specification
- Using AI coding agents in Cursor to accelerate development

## Running the Game

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Current Implementation

- Procedurally generated tunnel
- Dynamic colors and shapes
- Animation system
