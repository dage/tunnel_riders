Core Gameplay Loop
1.	Flight
	•	Steer the ship through a constantly shifting 3D tunnel.
	•	Avoid harmful debris, protrusions, and environmental dangers.
2.	Combat
	•	Battle alien monsters clinging to the tunnel walls.
	•	Dogfight rival spaceships with laser cannons, missiles, and EMP attacks.
3.	Progression
	•	Earn credits by defeating enemies and reaching checkpoints.
	•	Use credits to upgrade weapons, armor, and engine performance.
